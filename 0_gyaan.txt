4 Primitive datatypes in Python - integers, floats, str's, and bools 
(but apparently more? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-data-types/)

Tuples - same as lists but immutable

Dictionary - a collection of {key:value} pairs
           - ordered and changeable. No duplicates


Some key concepts - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMv6OSuitWw

In Python, you can only have one thread in execution at a time. This because a thread needs to acquire the Global Interpreter 
Lock (GIL) in order to execute. So if one thread acquires a Global Lock, the others obviously don't have it at the same point in
time.
    However, this rule only applies for CPU-intensive tasks. For I/O bound tasks (like network operations or disk access), using 
threads in Python can be highly beneficial because the GIL is released during I/O operations.
    For CPU-intensive activities, there are ways to bypass the GILâ€™s restrictions, such as deploying processes from the 
multiprocessing module or developing C extensions.
