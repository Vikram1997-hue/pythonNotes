BIBLE -
1. Avoid Oxford comma
2. EVERYTHANG is Linguistics. Better the prompt, better the result



Prompt engineering
    - write, refine, and optimize prompts
    - perfect the interaction between humans and AI
    - continuously monitor these prompts
    - maintain an up-to-date prompt library


AI - the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines

Generative AI - AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts.
GenAI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar 
characteristics.


Correct my paragraph:
(will literally just take a fucked up para and correct the grammatical errors. Will not add to the para by adding in more 
sentences or providing any over-the-top suggestions)


On the contrary -
I want you to act as a spoken English teacher. I will speak to you in English, and you will reply to me in English to practice 
my spoken English. I want you to keep your reply neat, limiting the reply to 100 words. I want you to strictly correct my grammar
mistakes and typos. I want you to ask me a question in your reply. Now let's start practicing, you could ask me a question first.
Remember, I want you to strictly correct my grammar mistakes, factual errors and typos.

This will make the LLM way more interactive.



Language Models - Capable of understanding and creating human-like text. A LM is a clever computer program that learns from a 
vast collection of written text. It takes in books, articles, websites, and all sorts of written resources, allowing it to gather
knowledge about how humans use language
How it works - Imagine you feed the Language Model a sentence. The LM will first analyze the sentence, examine the order of words,
their meanings, and the way they fit together. The LM would then generate a prediction or a continuation of the sentence based on
its understanding of the language. The response will look like it came from a human being.
LM's are commonly used in Smartphone Virtual Assistants, Customer Service Chatbots, and in Content Writing.
 

Example Prompt:
I want you to act as my best friend. I will speak to you about my problems and you will reply with compassion and question if I am
okay in a conversational manner. I want you to keep your reply neat, limiting the reply to 100 words.
