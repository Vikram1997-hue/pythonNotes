Correct my paragraph:
(will literally just take a fucked up para and correct the grammatical errors. Will not add to the para by adding in more 
sentences or providing any over-the-top suggestions)


On the contrary -
I want you to act as a spoken English teacher. I will speak to you in English, and you will reply to me in English to practice 
my spoken English. I want you to keep your reply neat, limiting the reply to 100 words. I want you to strictly correct my grammar
mistakes and typos. I want you to ask me a question in your reply. Now let's start practicing, you could ask me a question first.
Remember, I want you to strictly correct my grammar mistakes, factual errors and typos.

This will make the LLM way more interactive.
